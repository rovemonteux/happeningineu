INSTALLATION
============


1. Read and follow all instructions from https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Diaspora carefully. Make sure you are running Ruby 1.9+, not Ruby 1.8. The Debian package is named ruby1.9, not ruby-full. The database used in the development is MySQL, so some ActiveRecords might not work with PostgreSQL.

Just, of course, grab the Diaspora source from the happeningin.eu repository rather the official repository, using the following commands:

git clone git://github.com/rovemonteux/happeningineu.git
cd happeningineu

2. Do not run jammit, jammit will be removed from the next versions, and the entire stylesheet and javascript structure will also be changed.

3. Get a free SSL certificate for your pod at http://www.startssl.com/. Always use SSL.

4. Copy all *.example files in the config folder as themselves minus .example (eg. application.yml.example becomes application.yml).

5. Carefully edit all this files - double check each for the correct pod url, correct administrator, correct location of SSL certificate, etc.

6. Copy diaspora-init.d as /etc/init.d/diaspora, and then chmod +x /etc/init.d/diaspora

7. Again, make sure you are running Ruby 1.9+, not Ruby 1.8. Debian package is named ruby1.9, not ruby-full. If necessary, remove the ruby1.8 binary, link the ruby binary to ruby1.9, and install gem again.

8. Run "bundle install && bundle update"

9. Start the server with SERVER_ROOT/start.sh , restart with SERVER_ROOT/restart.sh.

10. Websockets for real time notifications and post refreshing

Most common error is lack of policy for it - if you get an error like

"cannot connect to Web Socket server at wss://host:8001/ (SecurityError: Error #2048) make sure the server is running and Flash socket policy file is correctly placed "

You might need to install this, http://socketpolicyserver.com/ as the server is not serving the policy to allow the websocket to talk.

11. Read the file log/production.log as often as you can, All errors and performance statistics are input in this file.

12. Do not get frustrated if it fails at first, it is normal, a bit of patience, and the log file above will help you diagnose and know your system better.
