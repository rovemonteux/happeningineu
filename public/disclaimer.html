<br/>
Your agreement to all the terms and conditions of this agreement ("Agreement") is required before You can use the <b>HAPPENINGIN.EU</b> (Herein after referred to as the "Service", "Website", or "Pod"). As used in this Agreement, the terms "Company", "we" and "us" are used interchangeably to refer to the operators of the Website (sometimes referred to as HAPPENINGIN.EU).
<br/>
<br/>
The parties to this Agreement ("Agreement") are you ("You", sometimes referred to as a "User" of the Website), and the owners of <b>HAPPENINGIN.EU</b> (the "Company"). As used in this Agreement, the terms "we" and "us" are used interchangeably to refer to the Company and the operators of the Website (sometimes referred to as <b>HAPPENINGIN.EU</b>). By further accessing the Website or materials available at or in association with the Website, and for other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency of which is acknowledged by You and the Company, You hereby agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
<br/>
<br/>
Happening In (<b>happeningin.eu</b>) is a public Diaspora* pod. As a public Diaspora* pod, all content inside our server is federated.	
<br/>
<br/>
Federated content is digital media content that is designed to be self-managing to support reporting and rights management in a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. When content is first sent from any Diaspora* pod, the content is sent to all Diaspora* pods in the Diaspora* network.</h3>
<br/>
<br/>
This pod is not, and will be not responsible for any content generated and/or federated in the Diaspora* network, nor any other network and/or website. Hereby we solemnly detach ourselves from any content circulating in the Diaspora* network.
<br/>
<br/>
Deleting content in one Diaspora* pod does not guarantee its deletion anywhere else, and the operator of this Diaspora* pod has no control over any content running inside the Diaspora* network.
<br/>
<br/>
As such, there is little that the operator of this Diaspora* pod can do to help you track content further. This pod is part of a decentralized network, so there is little that can be done to trace either legitimate or illegitimate traffic (or to filter one from the other). We cannot delete federated content, and attempts to seize this pod will accomplish nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, this machine also serves as a carrier of email, which means that its contents are further protected under the ECPA. 18 USC 2707 explicitly allows for civil remedies ($1000/account plus legal fees) in the event of a seizure executed without good faith or probable cause (it should be clear at this point that content with an originating address of @happeningin.eu or @diaspora.happeningin.eu should not constitute probable cause to seize the machine). Similar considerations exist for 1st amendment content on this machine.
<br/>
<br/>
If you are a representative of a company who feels that this pod is being used to violate the DMCA, please be aware that this machine does not host or contain any illegal content. Also be aware that network infrastructure maintainers are not liable for the type of content that passes over their equipment, in accordance with DMCA "safe harbor" provisions. In other words, you will have just as much luck sending a takedown notice to the Internet backbone providers.
<br/>
<br/>
As a free service, we make no guarantee about any provision of service, support nor uptime on <b>happeningin.eu</b>. The code may be fit or may be not, use at your own risk. Even though we try our best to keep the service running most of the time, it may or may not work, use it at your own risk. We are not and will not be liable for any damage due to usage of the free service at <b>happeningin.eu</b>.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>HAPPENINGIN.EU</b> does not solicit or control the information provided by any Member that may be made available through our system.
<br/>
<br/>
This said, by using this pod you confirm that you are aware of and agree with all terms stated in this document, located at https://happeningin.eu/disclaimer.html.
<br/>
<br/>
You acknowledge You Have Read This Entire Agreement. By continuing to access the Website and/or any service or other functionality available in, on, at or through the Website available at, in or through the Website, or by obtaining Content from any Website Content Providers, You agree that You are acknowledging and affirming that You have read this entire Agreement and that You agree to all its terms, conditions, warranties and other provisions.
<br/>
<br/>
Please take in consideration that all networks have a few bad apples, and it would be unfortunate to deny all Diaspora* users access to this pod indefinitely simply because of a few of them.
<br/>
<br/>
You agree that this Agreement and all disputes or controversies of any kind arising under, or related to the materials, services, features or functions available in, at, through or in association with, or in any way relating to, the Website, any Content or services provided by any Website Content Providers or affiliates and/or this Agreement, shall all be governed by and construed under the laws of the CZECH REPUBLIC. 
<br/>
<br/>
You and the Company hereby agree that the venue for all legal disputes, controversies, actions of any kind arising under or related to this Agreement shall be the CZECH REPUBLIC. You and Company agree that in case of any litigation regarding this Agreement, the venue for such litigation shall be, depending on the subject matter of the dispute, in the CZECH REPUBLIC. You hereby consent and stipulate to the jurisdiction of the Courts of the CZECH REPUBLIC.
<br/>
<br/>
Diaspora* is free, open source software, running in a free network mantained by volunteers worldwide. Happening In (happeningin.eu) is a fork that extends its funcionality.
