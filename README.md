## Happening In (happeningin.eu)

### Open Social Networking

This software was initially based in a fork of the 2011 Diapora* source code.

While part of a decentralized network and they all speak together, the code, structure, organization, features, theme, goals and philosophy of this software are not the same as the official Diaspora* software.

This software focuses primarily on being lightweight yet featureful, on decentralization and instant automatic distribution of public rich content across multiple federated pods, and privacy for private posts, by keeping privated data scattered among as many multiple hosts as possible, rather keep large scale private data in a single centralized server.

If you have never seen nor used Happening In, this source code is live at,

Registration is free, but Happening In advises that you install your own pod for yourself and your friends or company, keep your private data to yourself, and federate public content to all other hosts in the same network.

If you can't host your own pod, or join your company or friend's pod, you may wish to join one of the existing pods running the Happening In software as listed below.
