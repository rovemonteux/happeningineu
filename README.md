# Diaspora

The privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social
network.

[Diaspora Project](http://diasporaproject.org)

This is a fork of the Diapora* source code, meaning, while this code is based on the 2011 Diaspora* source code, this is not the same code as used today on joindiaspora.com, nor diasp0ra.ca.

Bug reports are not the same either, something broken in many other Diaspora* pods might be working perfectly in the happeningin.eu fork, and vice versa.

While part of a decentralized network and they all speak together, the code, structure, organization, features, theme, goals and philosophy are not the same.
 
If you have never used the happeningin.eu Diaspora* fork, this code is live at, 

###[diaspora.happeningin.eu](https://diaspora.happeningin.eu/)

And in other pods as listed in 

[List of pods using the happeningin.eu Diaspora* fork](https://github.com/rovemonteux/happeningineu/wiki/Pods-using-the-happeningin.eu-Diaspora*-fork)

## Are you a user?

You can get an account on any Diaspora pod(http://podupti.me or http://dspr.tk/a for a list of pods), or sign up for an account at a pod already running the happeningin.eu fork,
