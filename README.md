# Happening In (happeningin.eu) 

The privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social
network.

This is a fork of the 2011 Diapora* source code. No code has been shared since, and this project is taking a different direction from the Diaspora* main branch.

While part of a decentralized network and they all speak together, the code, structure, organization, features, theme, goals and philosophy of this fork are not the same as the main Diaspora* software.
