# Happening in EU (happeningin.eu) 

The privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social
network.

This is a fork of Diapora's 2011 source code, meaning that no code has been shared with the official source code since, but exclusively programmed for this fork.

Bug reports are not the same either, something broken in many other Diaspora* pods might be working perfectly in the happeningin.eu fork, and vice versa.

While part of a decentralized network and they all speak together, the code, structure, organization, features, theme, goals and philosophy of this fork are not the same as the main Diaspora* software.
