## Happening In (happeningin.eu)

### Open Social Networking

This software was initially based in a fork of the 2011 Diapora* source code.

While part of a decentralized network and they all speak together, the code, structure, organization, features, theme, goals and philosophy of this software are not the same as the official Diaspora* software.

This software focuses primarily on being lightweight yet featureful, on decentralization and instant automatic distribution of public rich content across multiple federated hosts, and privacy for private posts, by keeping private data stored in as many small hosts as possible, hosts often run by the owner of the private data or by someone the owner of the private data knows and trust, rather store large scale private data in a single centralized server or service.

If you have never seen nor used Happening In, this source code is live at,

Registration is free, but Happening In advises that **you use the source code to keep your data private** by installing your own host for yourself and/or your friends or company, and federate only **public** content across the network.

If you can't have your own host, or is unable to join your company or a friend's host, you may wish to join one of the existing public hosts running the Happening In software as listed below.

Read the INSTALL.txt file for how to get started.

THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE AND SHOULD BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY. IT IS FUN TO GET RUNNING, BUT EXPECT THINGS TO BE BROKEN.
